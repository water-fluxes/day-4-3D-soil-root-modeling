# Material for the day 4 of the summer school - 3D soil-root modelling - Tools for visualisation of 3D results

In this repository you will use

(a) Hydrus1D to simulate water flow in soil and 
(b) R-SWMS to simulate water flow in the coupled 3D soil-root system

To visualise the results of your R-SWMS simulations

you can launch the notebook here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/water-fluxes/day-4-3D-soil-root-modeling/HEAD)

you can lauch a colab notebook here:
